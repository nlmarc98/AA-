(* Domains *)
Variable P : Set.
  (* The set of living and dead persons. *)

Definition M := R.
  (* The set of money in euros as real numbers. *)

(* If you need more domains to formalize your sentence,
   add them here, including their meanings.
   If you do not need them then you must add a dummy as usual.
   'Variable V1: Set.'

(* Constants *)
(* In this assignment it is not allowed to define constants. *)

(* Functions *)
(* In this assignment it is not allowed to define functions. *)

(* Predicates *)
Variable isMan (* x *) : P -> Prop.
  (* Person x is a man. *)
  (* Look it up in the municipal base administration. *)

Variable isParentOf (* x y *) : P -> P -> Prop.
  (* Person x is father or mother of person y. *)
  (* Look it up in the municipal base administration. *)

(* Here you add your own predicates to the domain model.
   But look out: the domain model has to stay minimal.
   This means that you are not allowed to add predicates
   that can be expressed by using existing predicates.

   For example: 'Variable isWoman : P -> Prop.' should not
   be added since it can be expressed in terms of 'isMan'.
   
   Also here you need to add dummies if you need less predicates.
   For example
   'Variable P1 : Prop.'

   ALSO ADD THE MEANING AND THE MEASUREMENT!

(* Auxiliary predicates *)
(* Auxiliary predicates are not a part of the domain model,
   but they are convenient abbreviations for (more) complicated formulas.
*)

Definition isWoman (p:P) :=
  ~ isMan p.
  (* Person p is a woman. *) 
 
(* add auxiliary predicates if you like.

   Add dummies if you need less auxiliary predicates.
   For example:
   'Definition H1 := True.'

   ALSO ADD THE MEANING!
   (Measurements are redundant so you do not need to add them.)

(* Sentences *)
(* The last digit of your student number indicates which sentences you have
   to formalize.
   
   If the last digit of your student number is i, then you have to 
   formalize 'sentencei' and 'sentencej' where j=i+5 (mod 5).

   So if i=6 then you have to formalize sentence6 and sentence1,
   if i=4 then sentence4 and sentence9.

   For the other sentences you do need to enter a valid formula again.
   For example
   `Definition sentence3 := True.'
   
   You are of course allowed to use all entities that are defined above.
